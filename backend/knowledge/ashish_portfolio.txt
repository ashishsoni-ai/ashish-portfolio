## PROJECT 1 — IMAGE CAPTIONING MODEL
Name: Image Captioning Model
Status: Completed
Description: An end-to-end image-to-text system.
Architecture: CNN encoder using Xception (pretrained on ImageNet) extracts visual feature vectors. These features are then fed into an LSTM decoder which generates captions word by word.
Dataset: Flickr8k — 8,000 images each with 5 captions.
Technical details: Xception outputs a 2048-dim feature vector. The LSTM uses teacher forcing during training. Greedy and beam search are used at inference.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Xception, LSTM, Flickr8k dataset

## PROJECT 2 — REAL VS FAKE FACE DETECTION
Name: Real vs Fake Face Detection
Status: Completed
Description: A binary deep learning classifier that distinguishes real human faces from AI-generated or manipulated (deepfake) images.
Architecture: CNN-based binary classifier trained on labeled face datasets.
Pipeline: Raw images → face detection → normalization → CNN feature extraction → sigmoid output (real/fake).
Technical details: Uses transfer learning from pretrained CNN backbones. Includes a preprocessing pipeline for face alignment and normalization.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, deep learning, image preprocessing

## PROJECT 3 — AUDIO GENRE CLASSIFICATION
Name: Audio Genre Classification
Status: Completed
Description: Classifies music audio clips into genre categories using audio feature extraction and neural networks.
Technical approach: Audio files are processed to extract MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features and spectrograms. These features represent the audio in a format suitable for neural networks.
Architecture: Fully connected neural network or CNN over spectrogram images for genre prediction.
Technologies: Python, NumPy, Librosa (audio processing), MFCC, Mel spectrograms, neural networks, TensorFlow/Keras

## PROJECT 4 — RAG PORTFOLIO CHATBOT
Name: RAG Portfolio Chatbot
Status: In Progress
Description: An AI chatbot that answers questions about Ashish's portfolio using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
Architecture: Portfolio documents are embedded into a vector database (ChromaDB). When a user asks a question, the most relevant chunks are retrieved and passed as context to an LLM for response generation.
Tech stack: LangChain, ChromaDB, HuggingFace sentence-transformers for embeddings, Groq LLM API for generation, FastAPI backend.
RAG Pipeline: Document loading → text splitting → embedding → vector store → retrieval → LLM generation.
